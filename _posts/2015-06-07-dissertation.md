I completed my dissertation defense on Friday. It went reasonably well. I was pleased I could embed the Dart version of the model straight into my slides. I am amazed that RMarkdown + ioslides + dart work so well together. The only thing I couldn't do was to have the model learn on its own when a slide was called so that I always need to press "reset" before "start" when a slide containing the model shows up. Minor inconvenience but still.
