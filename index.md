My name is Ernesto Carrella. I am a graduate student at the [Department of Computational Social Science] at George Mason University.
I study economics. I do that with agent-based models. This methodology combines unrealistic economic assumptions with approximative computational techniques. A step forward.

Smarter people use computational models to push the boundaries of economics. [They](https://sites.google.com/site/nathanmpalmer/) either solve overwhelming mathematical difficulties or [they](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/people/563) integrate enormous databases into their models. [Some](http://www.davidmasad.com/index.html) infuriatingly even manage to do both.

But what if you want to shrewdly maximize long term unemployability? 
You cold try to do what I do. Build agent based-models about ideas that were obsolete 30 years ago. I deal with **economic cybernetics**. Which [Pickering defines as](https://www.uni-due.de/~bj0063/doc/Pickering.pdf):

> The world, understood cybernetically, was a world of goal-oriented feedback mechanisms with learning.
> Cybernetics,then, took computer-controlled gun control and layered it in an ontologically  indiscriminate fashion across the academic disciplinary board.

It's defined more in depth in [Machine Dreams](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Dreams-Economics-Becomes-Science/dp/0521775264).  And yes, the best definitions come from history books and are in past tense.
